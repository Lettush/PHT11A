    <h2>JavaScript Key Points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Statements:</strong> JavaScript code is composed of statements
        that perform specific actions. Each statement typically ends with a
        semicolon (;), although it is not always required.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Comments: </strong> You can add comments in JavaScript to
        provide explanations or make notes within the code. There are two types
        of comments: single-line comments, starting with //, and multi-line
        comments, enclosed between /* and */.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Case sensitivity</strong> JavaScript is case-sensitive, meaning
        that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently. For
        example, "variable" and "Variable" would be considered as two separate
        variables.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Whitespace</strong> JavaScript ignores spaces, tabs, and line
        breaks (collectively called whitespace) that are not necessary for code
        execution. However, whitespace can enhance code readability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Blocks: </strong> Code blocks in JavaScript are enclosed in
        curly braces ({}) and are used to group statements together. Blocks are
        often used in control structures like loops and conditional statements.
